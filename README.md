> Causal Effect based on a Single Time Series

**Authors:**

Introduction
------------

This package implements targeted maximum likelihood estimation of causal effects based on observing a single time series. We consider the case where at each time within a time series we observe in chronological order a covariate vector, treatment, and an outcome. We define a family of causal effects in terms of stochastic interventions on a subset of the treatment nodes on a future outcome. This general formulation of the statistical estimation problem includes many important estimation problems including classical time series models, group sequential adaptive designs, and even independent and identically distributed data when the summary measure of the past is an empty set.

Installation
------------

You can install a stable release of `tstmle` from GitHub via [`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/) with:
